Faulty Calcularol ðŸ§®ðŸ’¥
<br>
A fun and broken calculator built with JavaScript â€” on Day 31 of my web development journey!
<br>

This is my second project as I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead of working perfectly, this calculator gives wrong answers on purpose. Just for fun and learning!
<br>

ðŸ”§ What It Does
<br>
. Takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /)
<br>
. Calculates the result
<br>
. Butâ€¦ intentionally gives wrong results randomly to simulate bugs or add some chaos!
